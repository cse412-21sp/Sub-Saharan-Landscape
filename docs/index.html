Our goal is to dispel these misconceptions by exploring and analyzing trends around the continent to reflect the diversity of Sub-Saharan Africa. While it is clear that the Sub-Saharan African region has witnessed incredible amounts of changes in its social, economical and environmental landscape, these changes are nuanced and thus we will analyze these factors in Sub-Saharan Africa to find trends and correlations within this region.
The visualization techniques that we will apply in our explorational study are time series analysis charts, scatter plots, maps, and bar/distribution graphs, interactivity, and animation where useful. We aim to map out the gender-gap, poverty, education rates, employment rates, technological innovation, growth of the countries and several other demographic variables, and through these visualizations, we aim to debunk outdated myths and present a more accurate reflection of developments in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>Before digging down into the development of Sub Saharan Africa, let’s get an overview of the population distribution in Sub Saharan Africa with the following population density map:<img src="./static/images/a4 plot a.png" alt="example"/></p><h3 id="which-regions-are-seeing-rapid-developments-in-infrastructure?">Which regions are seeing rapid developments in infrastructure?</h3><p>Overall, Africa’s economic landscape has seen incredible changes in the last half century. </p><p>(TODO) The years animate as you scroll, and you can see that Nigeria, Angola, and South Africa have all exploded in economic productivity.</p><img src="./static/images/economy_1.png" alt="economy"/><p>We can dig down into different indicators of economic development such as electricity consumption, cell phone access, and air traffic. It is apparent that in recent decades, Africa’s countries can be grouped into three broad classes of electricity usage, the most significant of which includes large countries like Nigeria and Angola with newly developed economies as well as small countries like Mauritius and Seychelles.</p><p>(TODO) Integrate this d3 viz into Idyll.</p><img src="./static/images/infrastructure_2.png" alt="infrastructure"/><h3 id="let-us-now-take-a-look-at-the-poverty-witnessed-by-the-region.">Let us now take a look at the poverty witnessed by the region.</h3><p>The national poverty headcount ratio is the percentage of the population living below the national poverty line(s). Despite having a wealth of natural resources, poverty is caused by factors including corruption, poor governance, poor land utilisation , civil wars leading to unending political conflicts, poor infrastructure, diseases and poor health facilities among others. As seen by the map here, Madgascar witnesses the highest poverty headcount ratio and Somalia reports the least. <img src="./static/images/Poverty Headcount.png" alt="poverty headcount"/></p><p>When the top 10 richest countries in the Sub-Saharan region by GDP are looked at, we see that Uganda has the highest poverty gap (77.20%) while Tanzania has the lowest (6.70%). 10 of the world’s 19 most unequal countries are in sub-Saharan Africa. Growth in Africa occurs in sectors characterized by low absorption of unskilled labour, high earnings inequality and high capital share in total income. Growth in those sectors may spur GDP headline growth but will also exacerbate inequality. 
Inequality also results from regressive taxes, unresponsive wage structures and inadequate investments in education, health and social protection for vulnerable and marginalized groups.<img src="./static/images/Poverty gap.png" alt="poverty gap"/></p><h3 id="what-about-the-gender-gap?">What about the gender-gap?</h3><p>When we look at the relationship between the unemployment of males vs females, we see the general trend is that as the unemployment increases for males, it also increases for females. But what is interesting about this visualization is that when we look at the relationship between the unemployment rate for females and males for each country, we can see the trend for each of them and map out the gender inequalities that are present. We see that countries like Benin, Ethiopia, Mauritius, to name a few - as the percentage of unemployed females increased, 
there was significantly lesser change to the percentage of the unemployed males.</p><p>To interact with this visualization, click on the drop down menu and choose which country from the Sub-Saharan region you want to map out. <img src="./static/images/Unemployment.png" alt="example"/></p><p>Next, we went ahead and selected the top five richest countries in the Sub-Saharan region by GDP: Nigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya and Angola to see the varying trends for the life expectancy at birth for males and females for each of the five countries.
We see that apart from Kenya and South Africa, the other three countries had a positive trend - the life expectancy at birth for females and males increased over the years. Whereas for Kenya and South Africa, there was a period of time where the life expectancy decreased - we account this decrease to the widespread prevalance of the disease HIV/AIDS.</p><p>To interact with this visualization click on any one of the five countries in the legend, and then use the slider to change the years from 1967 to 2017 to see the trend over time.<img src="./static/images/Life_expectancy.png" alt="example"/></p><p>The final project will provide hands-on experience designing, implementing, and deploying interactive visualizations for the web. For this project, you will select a topic of interest and author a narrative article and accompanying visualizations to educate and inform a general audience. Think of your project as contributing to our own class newspaper or scientific magazine. The final deliverable will take the form of an explanatory narrative, deployed as an interactive web page using GitHub Pages. You will leverage the template and style provided here. </p><h2 id="the-theme-is-data-visualization-for-communicating-scientific-advancements-or-social-phenomena.-how-might-data-visualization-help-us-better-understand-the-workings-of-our-society-or-our-physical-world?">The theme is data visualization for communicating scientific advancements or social phenomena. How might data visualization help us better understand the workings of our society or our physical world?</h2><p>Your project must visualize one or more publicly accessible datasets of social or scientific importance. You are free to choose a specific domain of personal interest; for example, you might explore data relevant to your UW major. Example topics include transportation, economic development, humanitarian aid, legislative voting records, and communicating scientific research, among many others. Talk to the course staff if you have any questions regarding the project theme.</p><p>This template was created with <a href="https://idyll-lang.org/docs">Idyll</a>, which is a markup language for creating beautiful interactive webpages. For your own webpage, you can customize the particular components and layouts that are used, but the style of the overall page is predefined by our course theme. </p><p>Keep reading for examples of how to embed visualizations and modify the format.</p><h3 id="embedding-visualizations">Embedding Visualizations</h3><p>We can easily embed images inline by including a short code snippet referencing an image file: <code>![example](./static/images/banner.png)</code></p><img src="./static/images/banner.png" alt="example"/><h4 id="specifying-data-for-dynamic-vega-lite-and-d3-visualizations">Specifying data for dynamic Vega-Lite and D<!-- -->3 <!-- -->visualizations</h4><p>First, we specify the data that will be used in the visualization with a short code snippet: <code>[data name:&quot;sunshine&quot; source:&quot;sunshine.json&quot; /]</code>. We will reference this dataset with the name <code>sunshine</code> when creating visualizations in Vega-Lite or D3. </p><h4 id="embedding-vega-lite-visualizations">Embedding Vega-Lite visualizations</h4><p>Idyll has support for embedding Vega-Lite visualizations to the page using a similar approach to the standard image. To get started, we need to first install Vega-Lite by running the command: <code>npm i --save idyll-vega-lite</code>. We can then embed a visualization as follows (see the <code>index.idyll</code> file for the actual code):</p><div></div><p>The main Vega-Lite component uses the JSON syntax, but you can also create Vega-Lite visualizations using the API as follows:</p><div></div><p>The main thing to note when using the API is that you must call <code>.toSpec()</code> at the end of your code in order to make the <code>IdyllVegaLite</code> component behave normally.</p><span style="color:#aaa;font-style:italic" idyll="[object Object]">Fun Fact: Using the <code>.toSpec()</code> function is an easy way to port visualizations from Observable to your final webpage. Develop your designs in Observable as normal, then copy the JSON specification as follows: <code>JSON.stringify(myVis.toSpec())</code>, where <code>myVis</code> is the name of the variable containing your visualization. The <code>JSON.stringify</code> function allows you to copy the text (string) version of the JSON object. Note that you may have to adjust the JSON spec slightly when adding it to the <code>IdyllVegaLite</code> component in order to import your data appropriately.</span><h4 id="embedding-d3-visualizations">Embedding D<!-- -->3 <!-- -->visualizations</h4><p>Idyll has a pre-supported component for rendering D3 visualizations; to create a visualization, you can write a new component that extends this custom class. To see how this work, take a look at the file <code>d3-sunshine</code> in the <code>components</code> directory. In essence, you will create a seperate custom D3 component for each visualization that you would like to create in D3 for your page.</p><div style="width:100%"></div><div style="width:100%"></div><h4 id="embedding-tableau-visualizations">Embedding Tableau visualizations</h4><p>If you look at the <code>index.idyll</code>, this is how you can embed Tableau visualizations:</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/412demo/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="400"></iframe><p><code>TableauEmbed</code> is a custom component defined in the file <code>tableau-embed.js</code>. You can similarly <a href="https://idyll-lang.org/docs/components/custom">create your own custom components</a> for other types of embeddings.</p><h4 id="embedding-observable-visualizations">Embedding Observable visualizations</h4><p>You can embed Observable visualizations as follows:</p></div><div class="fullWidth"><iframe width="100%" height="445" frameBorder="0" src="https://observablehq.com/embed/@cse412/cse-412-section-3-vega-lite?cells=horsepower_acceleration"></iframe></div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><p>The original visualization is on the larger side, so we can display it using a <code>FullWidth</code> component so that the visualization spans the whole width of our browser window. While you can customize the size of the embeded window, the size of the <em>visualizations</em> will be the same as the original Observable document.</p><span style="color:#aaa;font-style:italic" idyll="[object Object]">Note: If you don’t like having the Tableau or Observable branding on your page, consider porting the visualizations to Vega-Lite or D3. Interactions will also be smoother and more responsive for visualizations that have been ported over, rather than those that are embedded from a different website. When designing your narrative, think about how important the interactions are for communicating the main takeaways, and decide on a particular implementation accordingly.</span><h4 id="embedding-plotly-visualizations">Embedding Plotly visualizations</h4><p>Similar to the other embedded visualizations, you can embed interactive Plotly visualizations using the custom component <code>PlotlyEmbed</code>:</p></div><div class="fullWidth"><iframe scrolling="no" style="border:none" seamless="" src="https://plotly.com/~kmarathe/1.embed?showlink=false" height="800" width="100%"></iframe></div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><p>Note that the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> parameters control the size of the <code>iframe</code> that is embedded in the page, <em>not</em> the visualization, so you will need to design your visualizations with Plotly accordingly, and test the page layout.</p><h3 id="changing-the-narrative-structure-and-page-layout">Changing the Narrative Structure and Page Layout</h3><span class="aside-container"><span class="aside"><div></div></span></span><p>The most straightforward (and default) style for a page is basic text like what we have used so far. Visualizations are embedded in place and are scrolled like a standard webpage. But with Idyll, we can do a lot more!</p><p>Take the Vega-Lite visualization from earlier, we can display it in the margin alongside the text by wrapping the code with the command <code>[Aside] ... [/Aside]</code>.</p><p>Perhaps you would like to try including a large image in the background, with text that scrolls by on top of it? With Idyll, that’s easy! Keep scrolling for an example...</p></div><div class="idyll-scroll" id="idyll-scroll-0" style="position:relative"><div class="idyll-scroll-graphic" style="top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:auto;width:100%;transform:translate3d(0, 0, 0);z-index:-1;height:0"><div style="width:0;position:absolute;left:0;right:0;top:50%;transform:translateY(-50%)"><div><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/412demo/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="600"></iframe></div></div></div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><div class="idyll-scroll-text"><div class="idyll-step "><p>
    To create this scrolling segment of the document, we first specify a <code>Scroller</code> component, which can just be done with <code>[Scroller] ... [/Scroller]</code>. The text and visualizations seen here are specified within this component.
  </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
    The background is that same Tableau map visualization from earlier, but displayed at a larger size.
  </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
    To set the background, you can use a <code>Graphic</code> component to wrap the <code>TableauEmbed</code> component from earlier.
  </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
    The contents for these text boxes are described with the <code>Step</code> component, and can even include other components like the visualizations from before!</p><div></div></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
    Take a look in the <code>index.idyll</code> file to see exactly how this works in the code, and keep scrolling for more examples.
  </p></div></div></div></div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><p>Idyll allows you to mix and match components throughout the document to create dynamic visualizations and compelling narrative layouts. Some other layout options include <a href="https://idyll-lang.org/docs/component/full-width">FullWidth</a>, <a href="https://idyll-lang.org/docs/component/inline">Inline</a>, and <a href="https://idyll-lang.org/docs/component/stepper">Stepper</a>, among others. Details are included on <a href="https://idyll-lang.org/docs/components">Idyll’s documentation page for built-in components</a>.</p><p>This page also describes a variety of the other built-in components for controlling the dynamic behavior of the document, such as <a href="https://idyll-lang.org/docs/component/dynamic">dynamic variables</a> and input widgets like (<a href="https://idyll-lang.org/docs/component/button">buttons</a>, <a href="https://idyll-lang.org/docs/component/range">range sliders</a>, and <a href="https://idyll-lang.org/docs/component/select">dropdowns</a>).</p><p>Let’s take a look at some dynamic visualization updates with another scrollytelling example. In this case, we will use a fixed visualization alongside the text and update the visualization as we go. Keep scrolling to see the example...</p></div><div class="idyll-scroll" id="idyll-scroll-1" style="position:relative"><div class="idyll-scroll-graphic" style="top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:auto;width:100%;transform:translate3d(0, 0, 0);z-index:-1;height:0"><div style="width:0;position:absolute;left:0;right:0;top:50%;transform:translateY(-50%)"><div class="d3-component-container"><div class="d3-component" style="width:100%"></div></div></div></div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><div class="idyll-scroll-text"><div class="idyll-step "><p>
    This <code>Scroller</code> uses some custom CSS to set the background color to ”#33333f” <div style="display:inline-block"><div style="background:#33333f;width:12px;height:12px" idyll="[object Object]"></div></div>.
  </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
    It also uses custom CSS to style the <code>Graphic</code> (which is a custom D3 component) so that it appears as a fixed visualization next to the scrolling text.
  </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
    What’s cool about this <code>CustomD3Component</code> is that it updates as we scroll. It does this by leveraging the <code>update</code> function to animate the point as it moves to a new position.
  </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
    To keep track of where we are in the <code>Scroller</code>, we first defined a dynamic Idyll variable named <code>myLocation</code> using the following code: <code>[var name:&quot;myLocation&quot; value:0 /]</code></p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
    Each time we scroll to a new <code>Step</code>, the <code>Graphic</code> updates it state based on this dynamic variable, which can be used to parameterize the visualization.
  </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
    Right now, the value of <code>myLocation</code> is <span class="idyll-display">0.00</span>. Cool huh?</p><span style="color:#aaa;font-style:italic" idyll="[object Object]">If you scroll back and forth between this <code>Step</code> and the previous one, notice how the value that is displayed changes based on when the new <code>Step</code> is triggered.</span></div></div></div></div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><br/><p>You can really put anything in these dynamic variables. For example, the Vega-Lite visualization we keep using could have been in a variable.</p><div></div><p>There’s a better way, though. What if we create our own new custom component? This way we can seperate out our visualizations into different files. See <code>components/my-viz.js</code> for the following example.</p><span style="color:#aaa;font-style:italic" idyll="[object Object]">How did we know how to write that file? We looked at the <a href="https://github.com/idyll-lang/idyll-vega-lite/blob/master/index.js">source code</a> of idyll-vega-lite. Idyll and its surrounding packages have their source on GitHub if you’re ever curious.</span><div></div><p>You can also use the Vega-Lite API like in the following example, found in <code>components/my-api-viz.js</code>.</p><div></div><h1 id="getting-started-with-your-project">Getting Started with Your Project</h1><p>This template is a starting place for your project. Update the header information to include the relevant details for your project, and then feel free to mix and match the visualization and layout techniques introduced here for your own narrative. Use this template and especially the <a href="https://idyll-lang.org/docs">Idyll documentation</a> as a reference for what you can do.</p><p>Think about how the narrative structure draws readers into the story you are telling and how the visualizations interact with the text (and with each other). The narrative should help ensure that the page as a whole is greater than just the sum of its parts. When designing your page, decide on particular layouts that enhance the reader’s experience and understanding of the topic.</p><h2 id="required-software">Required Software</h2><p><span>You must have Node.js installed. You can get it directly from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/.">https://nodejs.org/en/.</a></span></p><h2 id="installation">Installation</h2><ul><li>Clone and open your project repo on your own computer.</li><li>Make sure you have <code>idyll</code> installed (<code>npm i -g idyll</code>).</li><li>Run <code>npm install</code> to install project-specific dependencies.</li></ul><p>
npm is the node package manager. If you’re curious how this works and what the project dependencies are, open up <code>package.json</code> to see where these are listed.</p><p>You can install custom dependencies by running <code>npm install &lt;package-name&gt; --save</code>. Note that any collaborators will also need to download the package locally by running <code>npm install</code> after pulling the changes.</p><h2 id="developing-a-post-locally">Developing a post locally</h2><p>Run <code>idyll</code> from the command line. Your post will appear at <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>. When the server is running, any local change that you make will be deteched and your webpage will auto-update with the new changes. Your local changes will not be visible to your team members until you push the changes to your repository. These changes will not be reflected in the final website unless you run the build script and push the updated docs folder (see below).</p><h2 id="building-a-post-for-production">Building a post for production</h2><p>Run <code>idyll build</code>. The output will appear in the top-level <code>build</code> folder. To change the output location, change the <code>output</code> option in <code>package.json</code>, such as to <code>docs</code>.</p><h2 id="deploying">Deploying</h2><p>Make sure your post has been built, then commit the <code>docs</code> folder to your project repository. It will be available at <a href="">cse412-21sp.github.io/your-repo-name/</a>.
